# Learn Rust - Explore Basics

Learn Rust by exploring basic working code that demonstrates the essence of language features in Rust. It is recommended to first read the Rust Programming Language book prior.

To run any of the code samples provided, simply set your working directory to the `src` directory, and run `cargo run`, i.e.:

```bash
cd ./lesson-1-ownership/src
cargo run
```

## Motivation

This project contains learning materials for learning Rust. The learning materials are interactive in nature: the reader is encouraged to read actual code and inline comments that exemplify the language features of Rust, and in doing so, perhaps gaining understanding of the underlying motivations that surround the language features.

The target audience for these learning materials is anyone who is learning Rust for the first time, and has some basic prior programming experience. The reader is first encouraged to have read some portions of the [The Rust Programming Langauge](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/) book. The reader is not required to have fully understood the Rust language topics.

## Feedback

If these learning materials have helped you in anyway, or if you have any feedback, or simply want to contribute bug fixes, feel free to create an issue or a pull request for contribution.
